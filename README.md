# Stupid Hubot Tricks

A series of demos to show off  Hubot on Slack patterns I've developed. 
The demos are very specific to slack and hubot with jenkins and ansible but I hope
they can inspire techniques in your own environment, no matter what tools you're
using.
Rex Roof is a Deployment Engineer with Blue Newt Software, he became a Sys Admin in
1995 and has been trying to script his way out of it ever since.
