# Stupid Hubot Tricks
## Hubot patterns with Slack, Jenkins, and Ansible

I've developed patterns to address frustrations I have while doing this thing that people call ChatOps.  These demonstrations are meant to show off these patterns and explain my frustrations.   The demos are very specific to [slack](http:/slack.com/) and [hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) with [jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) and [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) but I hope they can inspire techniques in your own environment no matter which tools you're using.
